Liskov Substition Principle

In this principle,"overrided or child classes,major or parent classes can change places."By this Rule,parent class which inherited to child class and without unexpected behaviour it should be use as a parent class.
Classic example of this principle is,think a rectangle.Height is every value.Square is a rectangle that has same extend and height.By the way, rectangle provide us to extend as a square.For this principle,we should change rectangle class as a child class,square class is a parent class.We should create a parent class which contains all mutual properties.Then we create a class for all geometric shape.
