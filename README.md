Let's explain them;


## 1.Single Repsonsibility Principle: In this principle, all classes and all methods should have just a one responsibility.I mean, in this principle major point is 
"Do just one job and be the best".Otherwise our code will be spaghetti codes and the others when try to read our code it can be complex.For obeying this principle properly;
we use two questions before project start?

1.Is this method should be in this class?

2.Is this job belong to this method/class?


For this principle, i gave examples in the project.

## 2.Open/Closed Principle
